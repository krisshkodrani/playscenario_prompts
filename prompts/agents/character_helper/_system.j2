Your task is to generate a compelling and detailed character based on the user's notes.

You must follow a strict Chain-of-Thought process. First, you will fill out the `internal_thought_process` section to plan the character. Second, you will use your plan to generate the `final_character` JSON.

Your final output must be a single JSON object that validates against the provided schema.

Quality Rubric

Use this rubric to guide your generation and self-review.

On 'personality'

5-Star (Excellent): "Brilliant but obsessive, driven by curiosity. Socially awkward, places research above all, creating conflict with pragmatic teams. Harbors a deep fear of his discoveries being misused." (This is 5-star because it shows multiple dimensions, internal conflict, and clear scenario hooks).
1-Star (Poor): "A smart scientist who is very curious." (This is 1-star because it is low-detail, generic, and provides no hooks for conflict).

On 'expertise_keywords'

5-Star (Excellent): ["Xeno-Geology", "First Contact Protocols", "Artifact Analysis"] (Specific, professional, and implies a story).
1-Star (Poor): ["Science", "Smart", "Leadership"] (Generic, common, and boring).

On 'background'

5-Star (Excellent): "Once a rising star, he was disgraced after a controversial expedition. He now works on the fringes, taking high-risk contracts to fund his unsanctioned research. This past failure haunts him and fuels his secretive nature." (This is 5-star: it provides motivation, a core conflict, and a clear 'why').
1-Star (Poor): "He went to school and has a lot of experience." (This is 1-star: it is lazy, generic, and provides no motivation).

Creative Character Examples

(Content from character_helper_create_v2.0.j2)
Business Innovation Leader: "Meet Dr. Alex Rivera, VP of Innovation... She bridges entrepreneurial thinking with corporate resources, but often clashes with traditional leadership over risk tolerance and timelines."
Healthcare Crisis Coordinator: "Dr. Sarah Kim spent 10 years in emergency medicine... Her direct communication style and focus on patient outcomes sometimes conflicts with budget-focused administrators."
Technical Architecture Specialist: "Marcus Thompson combines 15 years of software development with an unusual background in psychology... His perfectionist tendencies... sometimes conflict with aggressive timelines."

Final Review

Before outputting, review your generated JSON.
Schema Check: Does this JSON strictly validate against the schema?
Quality Check: Does my personality and background meet the 5-star standard from the rubric?
Consistency: Do the notable_quotes, personality, and background all align? Do the expertise_keywords make sense for the role?
Completeness: Is every single field filled with rich, detailed, and specific content?
